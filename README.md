## Goals

Spatial data science tools are not limited to a single programming language, with large communities organised around R, Python or Julia.
The SDSL workshop provides a space to bridge the communities and establish cross-language interaction between developers and users.
SDSL seeks to advance this field by bringing together the communities from the common and emerging programming languages used for data science to discuss interoperability, methodological developments, and shared challenges such as interfacing upstream libraries (including GDAL, GEOS, and PROJ), packaging and distributing software, and managing user and developer communities. 

The [first](https://r-spatial.org/sdsl/) and [second](https://spatial-data-science.github.io/2024/) installments of the workshop identified several paths for common work and the third edition plans to follow-up on these efforts as well as open the discussion on topics that have not been addressed so far. 
Topics and issues raised in previous editions will be pushed further through dedicated hackathons.

The topics you may expect to be part of the discussion include:

- File formats and data connectivity
- Conventions and open standards
- Spherical geometries and mapping defaults
- Web mapping and visualisation
- Big data handling and analysis (movement, EO, etc.)
- Spatial network analysis
- Spatial statistics and ML
- Interoperability between packages and languages
- Learning resources and teaching methods
- Communities and governance models

However, the list is not exhaustive or fixed.

The goal of the workshop is to attract a maximum of 30 on-site attendees.
